<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="inject">
    <p>Pressing the button on the left side of the node allows a message on a topic
       to be injected into the flow. This is mainly for test purposes.</p>
    <p>The payload defaults to the current time in millisecs since 1970, but can
       also be set to a String or left blank.</p>
    <p>The repeat function allows the payload to be sent on the required schedule.</p>
    <p>The <i>Fire once at start</i> option actually waits a short interval before firing
       to give other nodes a chance to instantiate properly.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>"Interval between times" and "at a specific time" uses cron.
       This means that 20 minutes will be at the next hour, 20 minutes past and
       40 minutes past - not in 20 minutes time. If you want every 20 minutes
       from now - use the "interval" option.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>all string input is escaped. To add a carriage return to a string
    you should use a following function.</p>
