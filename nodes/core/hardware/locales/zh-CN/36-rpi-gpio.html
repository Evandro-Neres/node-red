<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="rpi-gpio in">
    <p>Raspberry Pi input node. Generates a <b>msg.payload</b> with either a 0 or 1 depending on the state of the input pin. Requires the gpio command to work.</p>
    <p>You may also enable the input pullup resistor or the pulldown resistor.</p>
    <p>The <b>msg.topic</b> is set to <i>pi/{the pin number}</i></p>
    <p>Requires the RPi.GPIO python library version 0.5.8 (or better) in order to work.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> we are using the actual physical pin numbers on connector P1 as they are easier to locate.</p>
