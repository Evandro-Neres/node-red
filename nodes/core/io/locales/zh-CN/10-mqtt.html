<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="mqtt out">
    <p>Connects to a MQTT broker and publishes <b>msg.payload</b> either to the <b>msg.topic</b> or to the topic specified in the edit window. The value in the edit window has precedence.</p>
    <p>Likewise QoS and/or retain values in the edit panel will overwrite any <b>msg.qos</b> and <b>msg.retain</b> properties. If nothing is set they default to <i>0</i> and <i>false</i> respectively.</p>
    <p>If <b>msg.payload</b> contains an object it will be stringified before being sent.</p>
