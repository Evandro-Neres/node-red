<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="tcp in">
    <p>Provides a choice of tcp inputs. Can either connect to a remote tcp port,
       or accept incoming connections.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="tcp out">
    <p>Provides a choice of tcp outputs. Can either connect to a remote tcp port,
    accept incoming connections, or reply to messages received from a TCP In node.</p>
    <p>Only <b>msg.payload</b> is sent.</p>
    <p>If <b>msg.payload</b> is a string containing a Base64 encoding of binary
    data, the Base64 decoding option will cause it to be converted back to binary
    before being sent.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="tcp request">
    <p>A simple TCP request node - sends the <b>msg.payload</b> to a server tcp port and expects a response.</p>
    <p>Connects, sends the "request", reads the "response". It can either count a number of
    returned characters into a fixed buffer, match a specified character before returning,
    wait a fixed timeout from first reply and then return, or just sit and wait for data.</p>
    <p>The response will be output in <b>msg.payload</b> as a buffer, so you may want to .toString() it.</p>
    <p>If you leave tcp host or port blank they must be set by using the <b>msg.host</b> and <b>msg.port</b> properties.</p>
</script>
