<!--  The Input Node  -->
<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="udp in">
    <p>A udp input node, that produces a <b>msg.payload</b> containing a <i>BUFFER</i>, string, or base64 encoded string. Supports multicast.</p>
    <p>It also provides <b>msg.ip</b> and <b>msg.port</b> to the ip address and port from which the message was received.</p>
    <p>On some systems you may need to be root to use ports below 1024 and/or broadcast.</p>
</script>

<!--  The Output Node  -->
<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="udp out">
    <p>This node sends <b>msg.payload</b> to the designated udp host and port. Supports multicast.</p>
    <p>You may also use <b>msg.ip</b> and <b>msg.port</b> to set the destination values.<br/><b>Note</b>: the statically configured values have precedence.</p>
    <p>If you select broadcast either set the address to the local broadcast ip address, or maybe try 255.255.255.255, which is the global broadcast address.</p>
    <p>On some systems you may need to be root to use ports below 1024 and/or broadcast.</p>
