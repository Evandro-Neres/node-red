    <p>A simple function node to route messages based on its properties.</p>
    <p>When a message arrives, the selected property is evaluated against each
    of the defined rules. The message is then sent to the output of <i>all</i>
    rules that pass.</p>
    <p>Note: the <i>otherwise</i> rule applies as a "not any of" the rules preceding it.</p>
