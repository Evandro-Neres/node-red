    <ul>
        <li><b>Set</b> - set a property. The <b>to</b> property can either be a string value, or reference
         another message property by name, for example: <code>msg.topic</code>.</li>
        <li><b>Change</b> - search &amp; replace parts of the property. If regular expressions

    </ul>
