<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="file">
    <p>Writes <b>msg.payload</b> to the file specified, e.g. to create a log.</p>
    <p>The filename can be configured in the node, if left blank it should be set in an incoming message on <b>msg.filename</b>.</p>
    <p>A newline is added to every message. But this can be turned off if required, for example, to allow binary files to be written.</p>
    <p>The default behaviour is to append to the file. This can be changed to overwrite the file each time, for example if you want to output a "static" web page or report.</p>
    <p>This node can also be configured to delete a file if required. <i>Note:</i> Using msg.delete is now deprecated.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="file in">

    <p>The filename can be configured in the node, if left blank it should be set in an incoming message on <b>msg.filename</b>.</p>
